We are in the process of completing mutual agreements for an additional six (6) million hectares.  Each hectare of rain forest captures approximately 20 tons of carbon dioxide (Co2) per year. At the same time, $RAFA  is working to finance other carbon generating projects and sell their carbon credits through its 3.0 World Metaverse (Platform)",
